# Tienda de mascotas
# Introduction
The next section will talk about the general idea of the project, it will talk about the purpose, scope, definitions, and references. 

## Purpose


## Scope

"Pets Store Management System " will be an application designed to be developed in Java with a database connection, where you can create, read, update and delete products from a store. It will have as data the name of the product, an ID and its price. Where the user will be able to consult said information. The products include pets, food, toys, collars, cat litter, cages, and aquariums. 
The users that can consult the system are the "cashier", owner-administrator, and the client.

There are different users with different authority in the system, to which, not all users can access the data in the same way.

Although the project can be managed and designed to be commercialized, it will be more focused on an academic purpose.

# Overall Description

The next section will give an overview of the system. The section will explain how the system interacts with other systems. These Systems can be a database where the data will be accesed. 
## Product Perspective

The system consists of an application for consultation and modification of data, therefore it is divided into two parts:
  *The first part is the area of the cashier, here the cashier can check how many is there in stock and the price of the product.
  *The application needs a constant communication with the database to retrieve the information in real time and thus show the current status of each pet, such as type, breed, age, and status. The status means if the Dog is ready to leave, or is still in care. It can be a cleaning procedure.

Change:
The consultation will be made in a separate way.
First, it will be checked if there is stock, and price of the product.
The you can make changes to these products


## Product functions

The main function of the system is to provide information to the user and the complete management of the system to the administrator. Thus making an application for the management of a Pets store.

## User characteristics
In these system, ther will be three types of users. The first type of user, is the client. 
1. The client can create orders, and pay.
The second user, is the employee
2. The employee, can check if there is stock of the product, and can confirm the order of the client.
The third user, is the administrator
3. The adminisrator, doesn't need to work on the stock, and confirmation of the order of all the clients. But he needs access to restock, and also modify the prices of the product. 

## Constraints
The different interfaces that are needed can become a restriction due to the difficulty of adapting. Since it opens a difference of navigation depending on the type of user.

The hardware can be an impediment due to the high cost it can generate for a simple electronics store.

If you want the end user to search for the product, you need a more functional interface that is face-to-face / physical.

## Assumptions and dependencies

## Apportioning of requirements

# Specific requirements

## External interface Requirements

Here you will see all the details about the inputs and outputs that have been planned for the system. There will also be a description of hardware, software and its communication between interfaces and a basic prototype of the user interface is also provided.
